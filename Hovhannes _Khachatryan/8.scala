/* Scala Arrays is a fixed size data structure that stores elements of the same data type. Array values are mutable, which
means that they can be changed in the future. Arrays are fixed size.
Unlike Arrays list's size is not fixed but the elements are immutable, that is one can't change the values of a list.
A set is a collection which only contains unique items.
Arrays are used in cases, where the size of data elements is known and the values of elements can be changed in the future.
For example we can store in an array weight,age and height of family members.
Lists are used, when the size of elements isn't known, but the values can't be changed in the future.
For example one can store people's name,surname,birthdate etc.
Sets are used when we want to store unique data.
For example, if we want to store information about users, we should generate unique ids to identify a specific user. 
These ids can be stored in Sets.
