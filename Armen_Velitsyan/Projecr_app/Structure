Main class of the package is expense class which is abstract class.
It has 2 methods: setData which loads  info into a CSV file and getData which loads info from the CSV files.
Two classes - Shoping and EatingOut inherit from the expense class.
TrInfo is a case class which contains attributes of the transactions (i.e. id, date, amount, description)
and is used in Shoping and EatingOut classes.
We also have Places abstract  class (with inheriting shopingPlaces and EatingPlaces)
which provides user opportunity to rate and comment a visited place and provides average rate and history of
comments of each place (shopping place, eatingOut place etc.) .
